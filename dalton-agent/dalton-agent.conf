# this should start with the engine name ('suricata' or 'snort'), followed by a dash followed
# by the version number.  This name must map directly to the engine configuration files on
# the Dalton controller. A value of 'auto' means that the agent will try to automatically
# determine this on startup (recommended). Examples:
# 'snort-2.9.9.0' for Snort 2.9.9.0; conf file 'snort-2.9.9.0.conf' on the Dalton controller
# 'suricata-4.0.0' for Suricata 4.0.0; conf file 'suricata-4.0.0.yaml' on the Dalton controller

# for a config file with a corresponding filename and '.yaml' extension.

# config will be selected based on the engine (SENSOR_ENGINE) and version (SENSOR_VERSION).
